# Probot Aider Bot

A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automates issue resolution with the power of AI. This bot uses [Aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) to generate code fixes based on GitHub issue descriptions.

## Features

- **Smart Mode Selection**: Automatically determines the best mode (architect, patcher, or hybrid) for handling each issue based on labels and content
- **Multi-Pass Processing**: Can perform architectural changes followed by detailed fixes for complex issues
- **Custom Repository Configurations**: Repositories can customize behavior through a config file
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges and labels to indicate which modes were used to fix issues
- **Interactive Commands**: Respond to issue comments to analyze or select specific processing modes

## How It Works

1. An issue is opened or labeled with a trigger label (e.g., `patchmycode:fix`)
2. The bot analyzes the issue to select the appropriate mode
3. Code changes are generated using Aider with the selected mode
4. A pull request is created with the changes
5. Visual badges show which modes were used in the PR

## Modes

### Architect Mode

![Architect](https://img.shields.io/badge/Architect-8A2BE2)

Designed for architectural changes, refactoring, and major restructuring. This mode focuses on:

- Improving code organization
- Implementing design patterns
- Enhancing overall architecture
- Refactoring for maintainability

### Patcher Mode

![Patcher](https://img.shields.io/badge/Patcher-2E8B57)

Focused on targeted bug fixes and immediate problem resolution. This mode emphasizes:

- Precise bug fixing
- Minimal changes
- Fast turnaround
- Preserving existing code structure

### Hybrid Modes

Special purpose modes for specific tasks:

- ![Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security-FF0000) **Security**: For vulnerability fixes and security improvements
- ![Performance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Performance-FFA500) **Performance**: For optimizing code and improving efficiency
- ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6) **TypeScript**: For TypeScript migrations and type improvements

## Commands

Use these commands in issue comments:

- `/analyze` - Analyze the issue and recommend the best mode
- `/mode architect` - Use architect mode for this issue
- `/mode patcher` - Use patcher mode for this issue
- `/mode hybrid:security` - Use security-focused hybrid mode
- `/mode hybrid:performance` - Use performance-focused hybrid mode
- `/mode hybrid:typescript` - Use TypeScript-focused hybrid mode
- `/mode multipass` - Use a multi-pass approach (architect followed by patcher)
- `/fix` - Fix the issue using the currently selected mode

## Configuration

Create a `.patchmycode/config.json` file in your repository to customize behavior:

```json
{
  "defaultMode": "patcher",
  "modeLabels": {
    "architect": ["architecture", "refactor", "design"],
    "patcher": ["bug", "fix", "typo"],
    "hybrid:security": ["security", "vulnerability"]
  },
  "systemPrompts": {
    "architect": "Custom system prompt for architect mode...",
    "patcher": "Custom system prompt for patcher mode..."
  },
  "modelMap": {
    "architect": "claude-3-7-sonnet",
    "patcher": "gpt-4o",
    "hybrid:security": "claude-3-opus-20240229"
  },
  "providerMap": {
    "architect": "anthropic",
    "patcher": "openai",
    "hybrid:security": "anthropic"
  }
}
```

   - **Homepage URL**: Your website or repository URL
   - **Webhook URL**: The URL where GitHub will send webhook events (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/api/github/webhooks` or use [smee.io](https://smee.io) for development)
   - **Webhook secret**: Create a random string and save it for later
3. Set the following permissions:
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - **Contents**: Read & write (for creating branches and commits)
     - **Issues**: Read & write (for reading and commenting on issues)
     - **Pull requests**: Read & write (for creating PRs)
     - **Metadata**: Read-only
   - **Subscribe to events**:
     - **Issues**
     - **Issue comment**
     - **Label**
     - **Pull request**
4. Choose whether to install the app on all repositories or select repositories
