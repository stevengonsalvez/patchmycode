# Product Context: Probot Aider Bot

## Why This Project Exists

Modern software development teams face consistent challenges in managing and resolving issues reported in their repositories. Many simple or routine issues remain unaddressed for extended periods, creating backlogs and slowing development progress. The Probot Aider Bot addresses this challenge by automating the resolution of appropriate issues using AI assistance.

By leveraging Aider, a conversational coding assistant built on large language models, this bot can understand issue descriptions, analyze codebases, and generate fixes automatically. This automation reduces manual work for developers, speeds up issue resolution, and helps maintain project momentum.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Issue Backlog Management**
   - Reduces the buildup of simple issues that take time away from complex development work
   - Helps teams focus on high-value tasks by automating routine fixes

2. **Knowledge Transfer**
   - Reduces dependency on specific team members for certain types of fixes
   - Creates pull requests that document how issues are solved

3. **Development Velocity**
   - Accelerates time-to-fix for labeled issues
   - Reduces context-switching costs for developers

4. **Onboarding Assistance**
   - Helps new contributors by automating fixes to common issues
   - Provides examples of proper issue resolution

## How It Should Work

1. **Triggering the Bot**
   - Users label an issue with a specific trigger (e.g., `aider:fix`)
   - The bot detects the label and begins processing

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - The bot clones the repository
   - It analyzes the issue description and relevant code
   - It determines if the issue can be fixed automatically

3. **Fix Generation**
   - Aider is invoked with the issue context
   - The bot captures Aider's suggested changes

4. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Changes are committed to a new branch
   - A pull request is created with the changes
   - The PR description references the original issue

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - The bot comments on the issue with the PR link
   - If Aider couldn't fix the issue, the bot explains why
   - Users can provide feedback on the PR

## User Experience Goals

1. **Non-Intrusive**
   - The bot should integrate seamlessly with existing GitHub workflows
   - Actions should be clearly labeled as automated
   - Users should maintain full control over accepting fixes

2. **Transparent**
   - Users should understand what the bot is doing at each step
   - Error messages should be clear and actionable
   - The process should be documented in issue comments

3. **Configurable**
   - Teams should be able to customize trigger labels
   - Comment templates should be customizable
   - Timeouts and other operational parameters should be adjustable

4. **Educational**
   - Pull requests should explain the reasoning behind fixes
   - The process should help users understand how to fix similar issues
   - Failed fix attempts should provide useful information
