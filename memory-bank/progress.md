- ✅ Reading issue details from webhook payload
- ✅ Adding comments to issues
- ✅ Creating pull requests
- ✅ Getting repository default branch
- ✅ Rate limit handling
- ✅ Error handling for GitHub API calls
- ✅ Repository access control (private/public)
- ✅ Branch existence checking
- ✅ Adding reactions to issues
- ✅ Adding labels to pull requests

### Aider Integration
- ✅ Enhanced Aider client implementation
- ✅ Aider installation detection and management

- ✅ Support for multiple trigger labels
- ✅ Support for comment templates
- ✅ Support for timeout configuration
- ✅ Support for various Aider options
- ✅ Configuration documentation

## What's Left to Build

### GitHub Integration
- ❌ Branch protection bypass for fixes
- ❌ Support for repository-level configuration files

### Aider Integration
- ❌ Better capture of Aider reasoning
- ❌ Support for interactive mode (optional)
- ❌ Support for repository-specific contexts

### Configuration
- ❌ Support for configuration via repository files
- ❌ Enhanced configuration validation
- ❌ Support for per-repository configuration

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests for GitHub client
- ❌ Unit tests for Aider client
- ❌ Integration tests for the full workflow
- ❌ Mock responses for GitHub and Aider
- ❌ Test for error conditions

### Documentation
- ✅ Detailed setup instructions
- ✅ Configuration documentation
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Examples of usage

## Current Status

The project is in a functional state with a robust Probot application that can respond to GitHub events and use Aider to fix issues automatically. The core components (GitHub client, Aider client, configuration) have been significantly enhanced for robustness and feature completeness.

The application can now:
1. Detect issues labeled with configurable trigger labels
2. Handle private repositories with proper authentication
3. Automatically install and configure Aider if needed
4. Create detailed pull requests with proper descriptions and formatting
5. Provide rich feedback via issue comments and reactions
6. Handle errors gracefully with proper cleanup
7. Support various configuration options through environment variables

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Add tests for the enhanced functionality
2. Implement repository-level configuration support
3. Add support for more advanced Aider scenarios
4. Enhance error recovery mechanisms

## Recent Updates

### Project Renaming (March 2025)
- ✅ Renamed the project from "Probot Aider Bot" to "patchmycode"
- ✅ Updated all code references throughout the codebase
- ✅ Refactored configuration variables from `AIDER_*` to `PATCH_*` format
- ✅ Renamed source files (aider.ts → patch.ts)
- ✅ Updated class and interface names to reflect the new branding
- ✅ Changed default trigger label from `aider:fix` to `fix:auto`
- ✅ Updated Git commit author from "Aider Bot" to "patchmycode"
- ✅ Updated all PR templates and issue comments to reference "patchmycode"
- ✅ Updated documentation in README.md to reflect new name and terminology
- ✅ Updated Docker image references

### Brand Consistency
- ✅ Made Aider the "behind-the-scenes" implementation detail
- ✅ Ensured "patchmycode" is the consistent brand users see in:
  - GitHub commit messages
  - Issue comments
  - Pull request templates
  - Configuration variables
  - Documentation

## Known Issues

1. **AI Integration**
   - Currently lacks support for repository-specific context (beyond what's in the issue)
   - No interactive mode support for complex issues

2. **Testing Gaps**
   - Still need proper test coverage
   - Integration tests need to be implemented
   - Need mocks for external services

3. **Configuration**
   - No support for repository-level configuration files
   - Limited validation of configuration values
   - Need better documentation for all configuration options

4. **Deployment**
   - Need to test Docker deployment thoroughly
   - Need to document deployment best practices
