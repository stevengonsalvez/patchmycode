# Project Brief: patchmycode

## Project Overview
patchmycode is a GitHub App built with Probot that uses AI to automatically fix issues in GitHub repositories based on issue labels. When an issue is labeled with a specific trigger label, the bot analyzes the issue, generates a fix using AI assistance, and creates a pull request with the proposed solution.

## Core Requirements

1. **GitHub Integration**
   - Listen for issues labeled with a specific trigger label
   - Clone repositories where issues are reported
   - Create branches for fixes
   - Submit pull requests with changes
   - Comment on issues with results

2. **AI Integration**
   - Execute AI code assistant to analyze and fix issues
   - Pass issue title and description to the AI engine
   - Capture AI-generated output and changes
   - Support configurable AI options

3. **Error Handling**
   - Handle cases where Aider can't fix an issue
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Clean up temporary resources

4. **Configuration**
   - Allow customization of trigger labels
   - Support timeout configurations
   - Configure comment templates
   - Support multiple Aider options

## Goals

1. **User Experience**
   - Make issue fixing seamless and non-intrusive
   - Provide clear feedback on automated fix attempts
   - Allow easy customization for different project needs

2. **Performance**
   - Handle issues efficiently
   - Minimize resource usage
   - Support concurrent issue processing

3. **Reliability**
   - Ensure robust error handling
   - Maintain state during failures
   - Log all operations for debugging

## Out of Scope

1. Training or modifying Aider itself
2. Supporting non-GitHub repositories
3. Custom code analysis beyond what Aider provides
4. Integration with CI/CD systems beyond GitHub

## Success Metrics

1. Number of issues successfully fixed automatically
2. Reduction in time from issue creation to resolution
3. Accuracy of proposed fixes
4. User satisfaction with automated fixes
